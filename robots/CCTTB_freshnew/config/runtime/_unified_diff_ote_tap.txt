SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
==================
1. EURUSD.tap.tolerancePips: 0.8 → 1.0 (+25% increase, 0.2 pip wider)
2. EURUSD.tap.expiryBars: 3 → 4 (+1 bar, more time to tap OTE)
3. XAUUSD.tap.tolerancePoints: 8 → 10 (+25% increase, 2 points wider)
4. XAUUSD.tap.expiryBars: 3 → 4 (+1 bar, more time to tap OTE)

RATIONALE:
==========
- Slightly wider OTE tolerances reduce missed entries due to price not quite reaching exact Fibonacci levels
- +1 expiryBars gives the orchestrator more patience before converting limit orders to market
- US30 unchanged (already has shorter expiry at 2 bars, appropriate for faster-moving index)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
==================
BEFORE:
  EURUSD: OTE must tap within 0.8 pips of 0.618-0.79 Fib zone within 3 bars
  XAUUSD: OTE must tap within 8 points of Fib zone within 3 bars

AFTER:
  EURUSD: OTE can tap within 1.0 pip of 0.618-0.79 Fib zone within 4 bars
  XAUUSD: OTE can tap within 10 points of Fib zone within 4 bars

IMPACT:
=======
- More forgiving entry criteria → slightly higher fill rate
- Longer expiry window → reduces premature limit→market conversions
- Still maintains OTE discipline (not removing the requirement, just loosening slightly)

NO DUPLICATES: orchestratorStamp preserved
NO CODE CHANGES: Only config/runtime/policy.json modified
US30 UNCHANGED: tolerancePoints=6, expiryBars=2 (retained for faster index behavior)
